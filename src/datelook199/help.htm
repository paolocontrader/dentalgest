      1. Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
      DateLook is a free electronic date book that features alarms, the ability
      to handle cyclic events, supports printing and is fully
      mouse-driven. It has an import/export-function (vCalendar V 1.0-format)
      and is able to synchronise its local database with a database in the net.
      The synchronisation can use FTP via TCP/IP or any net file system.
      Therefore it is suitable for multi-user-operation. DateLook provides an
      unconventional graphical user interface. It is written in Java and
      requires a Java runtime environment 1.4.0 or later.

    <h2>
      2. How to use
    </h2>
    <p>
      The <b>Main</b>-window is split into the upper part with a calendar and the
      lower part, the "events display", to show your events as
      coloured rectangles. When the mouse is over a rectangle, then a summary
      of this event appears. The "events display" has five rows
      used to group the events as you like (e.g. row 1: family; row 2:
      work ...) and to prevent overlapping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dragging with left-mouse-button or rotating the mouse-wheel shifts the 
      visible space of time. Dragging with right-mouse-button in the calendar or 
      rotating the mouse-wheel while holding the shift-key zooms the visible space
      of time.  If you use the wheel, then the shift or zoom speed depends on 
      where the mouse-pointer is: fast in the year-bar, medium in the month-bar 
      or slow in the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      A click with the right-mouse-button on an empty place of the "events display" or
      pressing control-m opens a pop-up-menu with the options:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Extended View</b>, <b>Goto</b>, <b>EventManager</b>, <b>Print</b>,
      <b>Predef Colours</b>, <b>Help</b>, <b>Save Pos & Zoom</b>, 
      <b>Revert &amp; Exit</b> and <b>Exit</b>:
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>
      In the <b>Extended View</b>-mode the <b>Main</b>-window is enlarged and contains
      additionally in its lower part the "summaries display". The "summaries
      display" shows the summaries of all visible events. 
    </li>
    <li>
      The <b>GoTo</b>-window allows quick changes of the shown space of time. 
    </li>
    <li>      
      The <b>EventManager</b>-window gives a quick overview of all stored
      events and provides the possibilities to search for or to delete
      groups of events, to import/export events from/to a file in
      "vCalendar V 1.0"-format or to synchronise the local database with a
      database in the net on a FTP- or any other file-server.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <b>Print</b>-option allows to print the shown <b>Main</b>-window in the 
      Extended View.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <b>Predef Colours</b>-option opens the window to 
      edit predefined colours. For details see <a href="#Predefined_colours">
      chapter 2.6</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The <b>Help</b>-option opens this User Manual. 
    </li>
    <li>
      The <b>Save Pos & Zoom</b>-option stores the position, size and the zoom-state of the
      <b>Main</b>-window for the next start of DateLook. 
    </li>
    <li>
      With <b>Revert &amp; Exit</b> DateLook can be left but it reverts 
      to the old database at start-time. Here all changes made in the local 
      database are lost. This is suitable e.g. if you accidentally deleted events.
      Changed remote databases are not affected. They remain changed.
    </li>
    <li>
      With <b>Exit</b> all changes remain stored and DateLook is left.
    </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Remark that pressing the F1-key opens the <b>Help</b>-window from each
      other window. Furthermore many functions can be controlled by keyboard.
      For details see <a href="#Keyboard">chapter 2.9</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note for Mac OSX users: To emulate the right mouse button (unfortunately 
      absent on Mac Computers) press the command-key additionally before pressing 
      the only mouse button.

    <a name="Creating_a_new_event"></a> 
    <h2>
      2.1 Creating a new event
    </h2>
    <p>
      Press the left-mouse-button into the "events display" at the place
      where your event begins and in the row of your choice. Drag to
      right to the place where the event ends and release the mouse
      button. Automatically the <b>Editor</b>-window appears. If you like
      to create a whole-day-event (0 - 24:00 e.g. a birthday) press 
      additionally the shift-key while dragging.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>Editor</b>-window shows different entries:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Begin</b> - time when the event begins,
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>End</b> - time when the event ends,
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Alarm</b> - time when an alarm is given,
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cycle</b> - repetition cycle (e.g. "2 monthly" stands for every
        other month), the number of repetitions (including the first) and the
        day of last occurrence,
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Class</b> - "Public" or "Private" (see <a href="#Synchronisation">chapter 2.8</a>).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A right-mouse-click increases, a left-mouse-click decreases the value of
      an entry. For fast changes the mouse-wheel can be used too. Alarm can be
      set <b>On</b> or <b>Off</b>. But there are three rules that must be
      observed: Alarm (if On) must be equal or earlier than Begin, Begin must
      be equal or earlier than End and for cyclic events it is not
      allowed to overlap itself. If one of these rules is violated you can't
      save the event but the wrong entry is highlighted red.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remark that there is no plausibility check for entered Begin-, End- and
      Alarm-times and -dates. If you enter e.g. the 31st of February or 02.30 at 
      the day when the day-light-saving-time is switched on the date or time would
      silently corrected to the 3th of March or 03.30 o'clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      DateLook handles cyclic events. For that you can choose in the
      Cycle-entry a multiplier (range 1 to 9) followed by:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>daily, weekly, monthly</b> or <b>yearly.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      With the help of the multiplier cycles of e.g. 2 weeks or 3 months can be
      chosen. Cyclic event occurs first like a non-cyclic event
      according to its Alarm-, Begin- and End-time, but later on periodically
      with the given cycle. Of course the number of occurrences (including the
      first) can be chosen. The range is from 2 to 999. For your information
      the day of the last occurrence is shown right of that number.
    </p>
    <p>
      An alarm (if On) is given for each occurrence. Note that the
      <b>Editor</b>-window shows the Begin-, End- and Alarm-time always for the
      FIRST occurrence of this event. The <b>EventManager</b>-window
      shows cyclic events only once at its first occurrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summary of the event can be entered in the <b>text field</b>
      using the keyboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to store additional information attached to that event,
      press the <b>Description</b>-button. The <b>Description Edtor</b>-window
      appears now. Here a longer description can be entered. As long as the
      <b>Description Edtor</b>-window is open the <b>Edtor</b>-window is
      locked. Changes in the description are saved only with the <b>save</b>-button
      in the <b>Edtor</b>-window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pressing the <b>save</b>-button saves the new event and closes the
      <b>Editor</b>-window. Pressing the <b>cancel</b>-button discards the new
      event and closes the <b>Editor</b>-window.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a name="ColourChooser"></a>
      You can individually choose the colour of an event by pressing the 
      <b>colour</b>-button. If done the <b>ColourChooser</b>-window appears. 
      As long as the <b>ColourChooser</b>-window is open the <b>Edtor</b>-window is
      locked. The <b>ColourChooser</b>-window displays eight rows for eight different 
      colours. Each row consists of a <b>Label-</b>entry, three <b>colour-values</b> 
      for red-, green- and blue-part of the colour (RGB, range 0 to 255) and the 
      <b>select</b>-button to choose that colour for the current event. In the 
      first row the current colour of the event appears. This colour can be changed 
      by mouse-click on the <b>colour-values</b>. Left click increases, right click 
      decreases the <b>colour-value</b>. Mouse wheel works too.
      In the following seven rows there are predefined colours and labels. They can 
      not be changed here.

    <h2>
      2.2 Editing or Printing an event
    </h2>
    <p>
      A right-mouse-click on an event's rectangle or summary in the <b>Main</b>-window
      opens the <b>Editor</b>-window for that event. Another
      possibility is to open the <b>EventManager</b>-window as described above.
      Here a right-mouse-click on an unhighlighted event's row opens the
      <b>Editor</b>-window for that event. A right-mouse-click on a
      highlighted event opens <b>Editor</b>-windows for all highlighted
      events. Coming from the <b>EventManager</b>-window in the
      <b>Editor</b>-window an additional <b>go to</b>-button appears to make
      this event quickly visible on the <b>Main</b>-window. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the <b>Editor</b>-window you can modify all entries. Furthermore here a
      <b>delete</b>-button appears to delete this event completely. The
      <b>cancel</b>-button discards changes and closes the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pressing the <b>Description</b>-button the <b>Description
      Edtor</b>-window appears to edit the event's detailed description.
      Changes in the description are saved with the <b>save</b>-button in the
      <b>Edtor</b>-window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>Print</b>-button opens a printer dialog to print this single
      event including its detailed description.
    </p>
    <p>
      In <b>Main</b>-window events can easily changed by drag-and-drop.
      With left-mouse-button events can be shifted to another date or row.
      Begin-, End- and Alarm-time are shifted by the same value.
      If you want to shift the event exactly by one day or you want to 
      change the row only without changing of time, then press the shift-key 
      additionally while dragging. After drop the <b>Editor</b>-window appears 
      automatically. To save the changes press the <b>save</b>-button or
      to cancel the changes press the <b>cancel</b>-button.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pressing the cntrl-key while dragging makes a copy of the event.

    <p>
      Open the <b>Editor</b>-window by a right-mouse-click on an event's
      rectangle in the <b>Main</b>-window or on the event's row in the
      <b>EventManager</b>-window and press there the <b>delete</b>-button. If
      you want to delete more than one event at once, then open the
      <b>EventManager</b>-window select all events, you want to delete,
      with the left-mouse-button and press the <b>delete</b>-button in the
      upper part of the <b>EventManager</b>-window. The button text changes to
      "sure?". If you are sure press the button again within the next three
      seconds. Otherwise the button will return to "delete" and you must start
      again. Note that the selection model is the same as for Windows(c). Use
      the cntrl-key to add/remove a single event to/from an existing
      selection; use the shift-key to select a whole area between an already
      selected event and the event you click on.

      If the Alarm-time of an event is reached or DateLook detects
      events with pending alarms (at program-start), then for each of
      these events an <b>Alarm</b>-window is opened accompanied by a beep.

    </h2>
    <p>
      First open the <b>EventManager</b>-window. Enter in the text field one
      or more search strings seperated by blanks. A search string can consist
      of alphabetic characters, numbers and special signs except of quotation
      (<b>"</b>) or, if you like, of nothing (to quickly select all rows). If a
      search string should include blanks it must be encapsulated by quotation
      (<b>"</b>). Pressing the <b>search</b>-button starts searching. Searching is done
      within the Date-, Time-, Class-, Cycle- and Summary-column of the table,
      not in the descriptions of the events. (Remember that cyclic
      events occur only once in the table.) As result all rows containing
      ALL of the search strings are selected and the table scrolls to the first
      hit. All other rows collapse to a small stripe. A left-mouse-click into
      the table re-opens all rows.

    <h2>
      2.6 Predefined Colours
    </h2>
    <p>
      DateLook provides the possibility to predefine colours for specific topics
      of events such as "family" or "sports" or what ever you want. The 
      advantage is that you have a better overview of the kind of 
      events in the <b>Main</b>-window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>PredefColourEditor</b>-window can be opened from <b>Main</b>-window 
      by a right-mouse-click into the "events display" and choosing the
      <b>Predef Colours</b>-option. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This <b>PredefColourEditor</b>-window displays seven rows for seven predefined 
      colours. Each row consists of a <b>Label-</b>entry, three <b>colour-values</b> 
      for red-, green- and blue-part of the colour (RGB, range 0 to 255) and the 
      <b>colour</b>-field to show how the colour looks like. Labels can be modified 
      by keypad. First click into the field you want to modify and then edit the 
      label text. The colours can be changed by mouse-click on the <b>colour-values</b>. 
      Left click increases, right click decreases the <b>colour-value</b>. 
      Mouse wheel works too. The <b>save</b>-button save the changes of the labels 
      and colours and closes the window. The <b>cancel</b>-button closes the window 
      too but without saving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remark that the events don't contain any information about labels. 
      They only contain the colour. This means if you change the predefined colours 
      later then all already stored events don't change its colour. Imported
      events have the colour chosen by its creator independent of his
      or your predefined colours and labels.

    <h2>
      2.7 Export and Import events to/from file
    </h2>
    <p>
      DateLook can export selected events to a file in "vCalendar V
      1.0"-format or events can be imported from a file in "vCalendar V
      1.0"-format. This is suitable if you are using DateLook at different
      computers e.g. at home and in the office or if you want to exchange
      events with other programs that understand the "vCalendar V
      1.0"-format.
    </p>
    <p>
      To export events open the <b>EventManager</b>-window. Select the
      events you want to export to a file with the left-mouse-button as
      described in the <a href="#Deleting_events">chapter 2.3</a>. Then press the
      <b>export</b>-button. A file chooser appears. Select a directory here,
      enter any desired file name (file extension .vcs is recommended) and
      press the <b>export</b>-button of the file chooser. That's all. Remark
      that an already existing file will be overwritten without any warning.
      You can use the "search"-function to select events to export.
    </p>
    <p>
      To import events press the <b>import</b>-button in the
      <b>EventManager</b>-window. Select a valid file in "vCalendar V
      1.0"-format with the help of the appearing file chooser and press here
      the <b>import</b>-button. After successful import the new events
      are highlighted in the <b>EventManager</b>-window. All other
      rows collapse to a small stripe. A left-mouse-click into the table
      re-opens all rows. If you dislike the imported events, you can 
      easily delete them all by pressing the <b>delete</b>-button 
      as long as they are highlighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The import feature follows the rule that each event with an unknown
      or without an Unique IDentifier (UID) is taken over into the own (local)
      database. Otherwise if there is an event with the same UID in the
      local database, then the LAST-MODIFIED-property is compared and the
      younger one is taken. If there is no LAST-MODIFIED-property in the
      event in file, then this event is not taken. But all
      events which are deleted during a DateLook-session (Start to Exit)
      are stored internally till the end of session. During import,
      events with same UID of a deleted event are not taken over
      into the own (local) database, if the deletion took place later then the
      last modification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remark that the exchange of events with other programs than
      DateLook can lead to the lost of some properties of an event.
      Because not all programs can handle all properties. Especially some programs 
      don't support cyclic events. Please, turn the special 
      attention towards the exchange of events between hosts in different
      time zones. E.g. an event starting at 08.00 will start at 07.00 after 
      transfer from a host in Berlin to another one in London, because this is
      exactly the same time if globally seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      If DateLook imports events created on a computer using a different
      character set, these events are displayed properly. But if such an
      event is modified and saved then all characters only belonging to the
      current character set (used on own computer) and not belonging to to origin 
      character set are replaced by question marks.

      2.8 Synchronisation
    </h2>
    <p>
      DateLook can synchronise its local database with a remote database in the
      net. The synchronisation uses FTP or any net file system. The remote
      database is stored in a file on a FTP-server or a file-server. This file
      is in "vCalendar V1.0"-format too. The synchronisation takes place in two
      steps. First step is the import of events from the remote database
      according to the same rules as described in <a href="#Export_and_Import">
      chapter 2.7</a>and the second step is to overwrite the remote database with 
      the updated local database. But here only events of the 
      <b>Class "Public"</b> are written to the remote database. This is suitable 
      for multi-user-operation to protect your "private" events from 
      propagation into the remote (common) database.
    </p>
    <p>
      All events which are deleted during a DateLook-session (Start to
      Exit) are marked internally till the end of session. If after deletion a
      synchronisation takes place, then events with same UID (Unified
      IDentifier) of a deleted event are not taken over into the local
      database and removed from remote database too, but only if the deletion
      took place later then the a last modification from another party. The
      remote database doesn't store any information about deleted events,
      except of that these events are removed from here. Therefore the
      remote database can not request the deletion of an event in the
      local database. If you want to delete an event from all different
      local databases, then it must be deleted from each local database
      separately BEFORE synchronisation. This is suitable for safety reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      To perform a synchronisation open the <b>EventManager</b>-window and
      press the <b>sync</b>-button. Now the <b>Synchroniser</b>-window appears.
      Here you have the choice between FTP-server or file-server. To change
      click on this text field. If you choose FTP-server and the FTP-server
      needs authentication, please enter your user name ("UID") and your
      password ("PW"). Otherwise leave both entries empty. Remark that the
      password is stored unencrypted in a settings-file. In the entry "H/P" the
      host name and the path of the remote database (e.g.
      "ftp.blabla.de/datelook/database.vcs" or
      "h:\blabla.de\datelook\database.vcs") is required. The file name of that
      database is free. If it doesn't exist, it will be created during
      synchronisation. Note that the chosen file (remote database) will be 
      overwritten with the updated local database independent of its old content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Press the <b>sync</b>-button in the <b>Synchroniser</b>-window to start
      the synchronisation. If finished the <b>Synchroniser</b>-window
      disappears and in the <b>EventManager</b>-window all updated and imported
      events are highlighted. If an error occurred during
      synchronisation, then the <b>Synchroniser</b>-window remains and shows an
      error-message. To close the <b>Synchroniser</b>-window without
      synchronisation press the <b>close</b>-button.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remark that simultaneous synchronisation of different DateLook-users in
      multi-user-operation can NOT lead to a lost of data (provided that FTP-
      or file-server works well). But it can occur, that not all local
      databases are really synchronised. Because there were a race condition
      between to "Synchronisers". For that reason it is recommended to
      synchronise the databases again if you recognise some unexpected delay.

      3. Files
    </h2>
    <p>
      Linux, Windows: DateLook itself comes as a single JAR-file <b>datelookXXX.jar</b>. 
      XXX stands for the version number. This file can be copied to a place where 
      ever you want. Best places are e.g /usr/local/bin or C:/Programme/....
    </p>
    <p>
      Mac OS X: The application and all needed files are located in the Folder
      <b>DateLook.app</b>. This folder is part of the download-file datelookXXX.dmg.gz. 
      If datelookXXX.dmg.gz is mounted you can copy this folder where ever you like. But
      the Application-folder is recommended. Remark that the Finder hides the extension 
      ".app". You only see "DateLook".
    </p>
    <p>      
      For all OS the settings files and the database are generated automatically and stored
      in the subdirectory <b>.datelook</b> of the user's default directory. These files are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>dates.vcs</b> - is an ASCII-file and stores the local database in
        "vCalendar V1.0"-format.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>dates.bak</b> - is an ASCII-file and stores the backup of local database in
        "vCalendar V1.0"-format.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>rc</b> - is created automatically, if the "save settings"-function
        is performed. The position and size of the <b>Main</b>-window and the
        zoom-state is stored.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>syncrc</b> - stores the synchronisation settings.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>colourrc</b> - stores the predefined colours and colour labels for the colour chooser.
      </li>
